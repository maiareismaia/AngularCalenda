// This file is kept for backwards compatibility and documentation purposes.
// In Angular 19, the application uses standalone components instead of NgModule.
// See main.ts and app.config.ts for the application bootstrap configuration.

// The application is bootstrapped in main.ts using bootstrapApplication() with the AppComponent
// and the configuration from app.config.ts which provides the router configuration.

export {}; // This makes the file a module
